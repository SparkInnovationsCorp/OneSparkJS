Retro Character Sprite Sheet
by isaiah658 - uploaded on May 6, 2016, 4:21 pm

Another sprite sheet that I made. Has the basic movements of up, down, left, and right. The animation looks a lot better than my previous sprite sheet. Consider this a template that anyone can use to make other sprites. I encourage you to try and make different characters with this example and share them on openclipart. :)
